# The map: one UI, many targets

Styles in cssints, components in Solid 2 JSX, drawn on a desktop GPU, on an ESP32's CPU, in a browser and in a
terminal. This page says which layer does what on each target, what is proven, and the order of the work.

## Four layers

| Layer   | What it does                        | Where it runs                       |
| ------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Author  | cssints styles, Solid JSX, state    | the editor (types catch errors)     |
| Compile | a style to a JS literal or to C     | the build (the cssints Vite plugin) |
| Layout  | boxes from styles and content       | the target: Clay                    |
| Raster  | pixels from boxes                   | the target: GPU or CPU              |

The rule (esp32 bean esp32-8j6y): **what can be computed at build time is computed at build time.** A style is data;
it needs no runtime on the device.

## Targets

| Target            | Styles          | Layout         | Raster                         | JS at run time | Status                        |
| ----------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Desktop (macOS)   | `cssints/clay`  | Clay           | Clay's SDL3 renderer (GPU)     | optional (Bun) | a page in a window            |
| ESP32-S3          | `cssints/clay`  | Clay           | esp32's `render.c`, CPU bands  | none           | one element proven on board   |
| Browser (WASM)    | `cssints/clay`  | Clay (C→WASM)  | canvas                         | the page       | exists in esp32 storybook     |
| ESP32-P4          | `cssints/clay`  | Clay           | CPU + PPA (2D DMA)             | none           | later, needs a board          |
| Terminal          | `cssints/clay`  | Clay (cells)   | Clay's `termbox2` renderer     | optional (Bun) | after desktop; replaces `cssints/tui` |

Facts behind it:

- Clay ships renderers: `SDL3`, `SDL2`, `GLES3`, `sokol`, `raylib`, `cairo`, `web`, `win32_gdi`, `terminal`,
  `termbox2` (checked 2026-10-19). SDL3 3.4.14 is installed here.
- The ESP32-S3 has no GPU: raster is 17.8 ms of a 22.8 ms frame, layout 3.3 ms (board log, 2026-10-19).
- esp32's `ui.c` and `render.c` are plain C with no ESP-IDF; `host/test.c` already runs them on a Mac.

## Why desktop first

- It is where the framework has to grow: windows, input, text shaping, a GPU raster, live reload, Solid. The board
  only needs what the desktop already proved, compiled to C.
- The loop is seconds, not a flash. Every later target is checked against desktop frames.
- The board is proven at the one point that was risky (generated C equals hand-written C, on the device). It does
  not block anything, so it waits.

Other targets **later, not in parallel**: each one is a renderer choice under the same layout, so doing them after
the desktop costs a renderer, not a redesign. One exception runs alongside at no cost: `test.sh` keeps checking the
generated C against esp32's `clay.h`, so the board path cannot rot.

## The terminal

A Clay target like the others: Clay's numbers have no unit, so a measure function that returns one per character
lays out in cells, and Clay's `termbox2` renderer draws them. Focus, text input and the caret are built once in the
framework for the desktop and reused here; the system theme of `@cssints/tui/system` is renderer-neutral and comes
along.

It replaces `cssints/tui` and its OpenTUI and bomb.sh adapters, but not before it can carry what they carry today:
apps/csssky-tui and the docs' `/tui` page. Then `cssints/tui` is deprecated, csssky-tui moves over, and the old
subpath is removed in a breaking release with a migration. Lengths stay per target: a style in cells is not a style
in pixels, so a terminal page has its own styles under the same member names.

## Where Solid runs

| Target   | Solid                                                                     |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Desktop  | Solid 2 universal renderer building Clay's tree each frame (Bun FFI)      |
| ESP32    | none at run time: JSX evaluated at build time to C, state in C            |
| Terminal | the desktop's universal renderer over Clay, cells for pixels              |

Measured for the ESP32: QuickJS 38 ms a UI turn (retired, esp32-mkn5); scriptc 0.3.6 has no Xtensa/RISC-V target and
segfaults on one Solid 2 `createSignal`; porffor is alpha.

## The contract

`ClayShape` of `cssints/clay`: the fields of `Clay_ElementDeclaration` and `Clay_TextElementConfig`. The plugin writes
it as a JS literal (desktop, browser) and `header()` as C (firmware). Text is per target: shaped glyphs on the
desktop, 4-bit bitmaps by `fontId` on the board.

## Order of work

Each step ends in a check that fails when it breaks.

1. **Done.** `cssints/clay`, `header()`, `generator/clay-header.ts`; `test.sh`: generated C gives the same render
   commands as hand-written C; the Units pill flashed and working on the board.
2. **Done: desktop window.** `vendor/clay` (clay.h and the SDL3 renderer at `e6cc369`, the same clay.h as the
   firmware's), `desktop/host.c`: a window on Metal, or one frame headless on SDL's software renderer.
   `examples/sensors`: the Sensors page from `styles.ts`, with a fixed sample. Check: two stored frames, before and
   after a scripted click on Units, compared pixel for pixel.
   **Done: the ThorVG raster.** `desktop/clay_renderer_thorvg.c`: Clay's commands as a ThorVG scene on its software
   canvas (brew thorvg 1.1.3, CPU engine only), `host --raster thorvg`, the default raster (`--raster sdl` is Clay's); text measured by ThorVG too.
    Check: two
   stored frames of its own (`expected-thorvg*.png`). Headless on an M2, the same 360x360 frame, one thread: ThorVG
   0.30 ms, SDL's software renderer 1.2 ms (2026-10-19; it does not transfer to the board). GL/WebGPU engines need a
   ThorVG built with them; then the ESP32-S3: ThorVG SW against `render.c`'s 17.8 ms, measured on the board.

3. **Done: states, tokens, fonts in `cssints/clay`.** `css.hover`/`focus`/`active` print as whole declarations of
   their own (`units_active`); `createTokens` and `createGlobalTheme(tokens, "light", ...)` print every style again
   per theme (`units_light`, `units_active_light`, `title_text_light`), so a page switches at run time by a suffix;
   `fonts("Roboto")` sets `fontId` and prints the font order as an enum. `examples/sensors`: colours as tokens, the
   the pill as `css.hover` and `css.active` (page.c picks `units_hover` over it, `units_active` when held), `THEME=light` for the light theme.
   The pressed look lifts the surface instead of the firmware's `ACCENT_DOWN` orange, which left the ink at 1.28:1; the
   ink on the base, hover and pressed fills is asserted at 4.5:1 and up in `solid/test.ts` (dark 15.8/10.3/7.9, light
   15.8/14.4/12.6). The firmware's `ACCENT_DOWN` is gone the same day: a pressed control sinks to `PRESSED` (28,31,40), since its rows
   carry DIM and ACCENT text too (TEXT 13.9, DIM 5.9, ACCENT 6.7). Flashed and seen on the board (2026-10-19):
   the pill and a settings row sink while held, no Clay errors, 55 commands, 22.8 ms a frame.
   Check: cssints test/clay.mjs; `expected-light.png`; and
   `examples/sensors/header.c`, the header's states and theme asserted in C99 against esp32's clay.h. In the window,
   the `t` key toggles the theme; `expected-pressed.png` stores the pressed frame (`--press`, held down). Seen in the live window (2026-10-19): `t` switches the theme, the pill presses and toggles the unit.

4. **Solid on the desktop.** A universal renderer over Clay through `bun:ffi`, live state, reload on save. Check:
   a click changes a signal and the next frame.
   **Done: the renderer and the Sensors page** (`solid/`, solid-js 2.0.0-rc.13, @solidjs/universal and
   @solidjs/compiler rc.13). The universal renderer keeps a JS tree; each frame it is declared to Clay through flat
   `bun:ffi` calls into a dylib (Clay + ThorVG + SDL3), styles from `examples/sensors/styles.ts` through the cssints
   plugin, theme and `:active` picked at run time. Check: `solid/test.sh` renders the Solid page headless and compares
   it with the C page's three ThorVG frames, pixel for pixel (identical), plus the pressed look and click rules. Cost:
   about 0.4 ms a frame on an Apple-silicon Mac, 0.006 ms of it the JS walk and FFI, the rest ThorVG's raster. Left: reload on save,
   JSX types, the window checked by eye.
   **Headless widgets** (`headless/`, between Solid and JSX to C). The first widgets of effects-of-atmosphere's
   `@eoa/headless` (button, switch, checkbox, disclosure, radio, tabs, toolbar, slider, tree) with no DOM: Solid 2 signals for state and, instead of aria-*
   attributes, parts of plain fields (`id`, `role`, `checked`, `selected`, `expanded`, `controls`, `tabIndex`, `hidden`, `disabled`, `focused`, `valueNow`, `level`, `posInSet`, `setSize`)
   with handlers (`press()`, `key(name)`, `focus()`, `blur()`) that a Clay renderer and an accessibility tree both read. Radio, tabs, toolbar and the tree are groups of the focus manager
   (`focus/`) on one page: roving focus inside, Tab between them. The slider is one entry.
   Check: the ported APG scenarios and a seeded random walk, replayed on the parts and on the generated Quint model,
   must agree (`bun test` in `headless/`, in `test.sh`); dropping a controlled request's callback fails 39 tests.
   **Dialog and menu** (`headless/src/dialog.ts`, `headless/src/menu.ts`): the modal dialog (a trap over the focus
   manager: opening moves focus to the first control, Tab and Shift+Tab cycle it, Escape closes and restores) and the
   menu button with the checkable menus (`createMenu`; the menubar is not ported). Check: the dialog's 161 scenarios (32
   replayed, 112 gated by the bridge — `modal: false`, focus attrs — 17 carried divergences) and five walks; the plain
   menu's 114 (19 / 86 / 9) and the checkable menu's 34 (16 / 14 / 4), with their walks. Left: the menubar, other
   overlays, tree type-ahead.
   **Done: the Widgets page** (`solid/app/Widgets.tsx`, `bun solid/main.ts widgets`): the headless widgets and the focus
   manager wired to one live page; the page's styles sit in `Widgets.tsx` itself (the loader compiles JSX, then cssints
   on the result, in one child: colocation without a separate `styles.ts`). SDL key events reach JS through a queue in the FFI; a key goes to the focus manager
   (Tab, Shift+Tab, arrows), then the focused part (Space fires on key up), then the page; a press focuses a part as a
   browser does and a press on empty space blurs; `:focus` is a style state like `:active` (a 2px ring, laid over the
   pressed look). Check: six stored frames (initial, Tab Tab, switch on, mixed, disclosure open, light) and
   `solid/widgets.test.ts` (Tab order, key timing, clicks and focus, the disabled box). Seen by eye: the frames; the live window
   was started, its keys and mouse not tried by hand.
   **Done: radio, tabs, slider, toolbar on the page.** The four groups of `headless/` on the same page (360x608), in the one
   shared focus manager: radio, tabs and toolbar are its groups (roving focus, one Tab stop each; the checked radio and
   the selected tab are the entry, the toolbar remembers its last item), the slider is one entry whose rail takes the
   focus ring (the value text stays outside it) and whose rail (or knob) takes a press (`ui_bounds` gives the ratio). A held press drags: each frame's
   pointer x is the ratio, so the knob follows and the value changes continuously; a release ends it. A key goes to the manager only for Tab; an arrow is the focused part's, which moves
   focus and checks or selects. Check: eleven stored frames (the old six regenerated at the new height, their old layout
   unchanged above the new widgets; radio, tabs, slider, slider dragged, toolbar re-entered) and asserts for the full Tab
   order, one stop a group, arrows, clamping, memory, a disabled radio, the rail, the drag, the rail's ring. Seen by
   eye: the eleven frames; the window was started (`--frames 60`), its keys and mouse not tried by hand.
   **Done: the tree on the page.** The sixth group is `headless/`'s settings tree (360x760 now): Network open with
   Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, Display closed with Brightness, Storage a leaf — six nodes, one level of nesting. It shares the
   page's focus manager, so it is one more Tab stop (the twelfth) entered at the first visible row, and its keys reach the
   part as any focused part's do (no page-level key handling): Up and Down, Home and End walk the visible rows only (a
   closed subtree's node has `tabIndex: -1` and is not even in the Solid tree), Right opens a closed parent and steps into
   an open one, Left closes or steps to the parent, Space selects, Enter opens and selects, a click does both and focuses.
   The row's left padding is 18px a level, `+`/`-` marks a parent, the selected row is the panel surface with an accent
   label, and the roving row takes the same 2px ring as the other rows (both themes; the accent on the surface is
   asserted at 4.5:1). The page grew to 760 so the tallest state (panel open and Display open) still fits and nothing is
   shrunk. Check: five tree frames (Tab in, Down, Right on the closed Display, Space, light) and asserts for the stop,
   the entry, the visible-only arrows, Right and Left, Home and End, Space, the ring following the roving row, a hidden
   node skipped, the indent, and the page fitting. Seen by eye: all sixteen frames; the window started with
   `--frames 60`, exit 0, its keys and mouse not tried by hand.
   **Done: the toolbar's menu button, and the menubar in `headless/`.** The toolbar's third item is now a menu button
   (`createMenu`, radio items Small/Medium/Large, Medium checked): the item's label shows the chosen size, it carries
   `aria-haspopup`, and Down, Up, Enter or Space open the menu as a capturing float under the item (`css.float({ parent:
   "format-item-2", ... })`), so the page under it is unreachable by that press. Inside, the arrows and Home/End move,
   Enter picks and closes, Escape closes and returns focus to the item, Tab closes and goes on; the page routes it through
   `input.modal`. The toolbar's roving focus treats it as one more item (Left/Right/Home/End, one Tab stop, memory), and
   the ring is now the slider's rail only, so the value text sits outside it. `headless/` also gained eoa's
   `createMenubar` (the roving bar, a menu per item, one more level of submenus, the focus manager in place of
   `document.activeElement`), its `menu-menubar.qnt` bridge, model and both scenario files vendored byte for byte from
   `09f2185`. Check: 74 menubar scenarios (26 replayed, 30 gated by the bridge, 18 carried divergences) and one walk;
   breaking Escape's focus return fails the walk and the unit test. The page: a new `widgets-toolbar-menu` frame and
   asserts for the ring on the rail only (and none on the readout), opening by Down/Up/Enter, the menu's arrows, Home/End,
   Enter picking, Escape returning focus, Tab closing, the float's `ui.bounds` under the item, a click picking, and the
   toolbar's roving with the menu button in it. Seen by eye: all seventeen Widgets frames; every frame that shows the
   toolbar changed with the third item's label (the change is confined to that item), and the two slider frames also with
   the ring. The window was started (`--frames 60`, exit 0); its keys and mouse were not tried by hand.
   **Done: floating overlays on a page** (`solid/app/Dialog.tsx`, `bun solid/main.ts dialog`). `css.float` is carried
   through `pack.ts` and `ui_open` (the style grew from 32 to 45 floats: what to attach to, the attach points, offset,
   expand, z-index, pointer capture, clip, and the parent id as two 16-bit halves, since a float32 cannot hold Clay's
   32-bit hash). A float is a layout root of its own, so the page behind it keeps its layout, and a capturing float hides
   what is under it from `Clay_PointerOver`: the modal's backdrop is a root float of the whole window and swallows every
   press, the dialog is a root float centred on the root, and the menu hangs off its trigger by id. The dialog's trap is
   the keyboard half (`input.modal`: Tab and Shift+Tab cycle its controls, Escape closes) and focus returns to the
   trigger. Check: four stored frames (closed, open, the light theme, the menu open) and `solid/dialog.test.ts` (the
   trap, Escape and Cancel, OK's write, the backdrop swallowing a press, `ui.bounds` of both floats, the page's layout
   unchanged, the menu's arrows, Escape back to the trigger, Enter and a click picking). Seen by eye: the four frames.
   The window was started for the page (`--frames 60`, exit 0); its keys and mouse were not tried by hand.
   **Done: a text field** (`solid/app/Field.tsx`, `bun solid/main.ts form`; `headless/src/textfield.ts`). Text is a
   second path beside the keys: while a text field has focus the host turns on SDL's text input (`ui_text_input` →
   `SDL_StartTextInput`/`Stop`), the poll queues every `SDL_EVENT_TEXT_INPUT` next to the keys (a composed run of UTF-8,
   never a keycode) and `ui_text_pop` hands it to `Input.textInput`, which inserts it into the focused part; the key
   queue is untouched. Editing keys stay keys — `Backspace` and `Delete` joined the names, and `selectionName` keeps
   Shift on the arrows/Home/End (the focus manager still only gets plain Tab, and `keyName`'s contract is unchanged) —
   and Cmd/Ctrl+C/X/V go through SDL's clipboard in C (`ui_clipboard_get`/`set`). The neutral `createTextField` is
   **ours, not a port**: eoa has no textfield and `specs/apg/` has no textbox, so there is no vendor file, model or walk
   and the conformance counts did not move. Its part is `role: "textbox"` with `value`, `caret`, `selection`, `valueText`,
   `readOnly`, `disabled`, `focused`, `tabIndex`, `editsText`; handlers `insert`, `keyDown`, `focus`/`blur`,
   `press(x, advance)`, `clipboard`. The page draws the caret and the selection by laying the value out as up to three
   text runs with a 1px caret box between them (Clay has no text attributes, so this needs no per-glyph measure; the
   caret costs that 1px of layout), and only a press needs an advance: the row's `ui.bounds` width over the text's
   length, an approximation a proportional font can be a character off. Check: five stored frames (empty with the caret,
   "Ada", Shift+ArrowLeft×2, submitted, light) and `solid/field.test.ts` (typing reaches only the focused field, the
   theme key after Escape blurs, the caret's and the selection run's pixels and x, the arrows, Backspace/Delete,
   `maxLength` 24, a press placing the caret, the read-only field refusing edits, Enter and Submit showing the value
   once, the page fitting); 26 unit tests in `headless/test/textfield.test.ts`. Inserting at the start instead of at the
   caret fails seven of them and two asserts of the page test. Seen by eye: the five frames, zoomed; the window started
   (`--frames 60`, exit 0) but typing in it was not tried by hand. Left: bidi, grapheme clusters (an index is a UTF-16
   unit), wrapping and multiline, undo, IME composition state (SDL's text events are committed characters), drag-select,
   and the caret's 1px layout cost.
   **Done: scrolling** (`solid/app/List.tsx`, `bun solid/main.ts list`). Clay's own scroll containers, driven by the host:
   `ui_window_poll` adds every SDL wheel event to the frame (`ui_wheel`), `ui_begin` calls
   `Clay_UpdateScrollContainers(false, delta, dt)` before `Clay_BeginLayout` so the container under the pointer moves by
   the wheel and clamps itself to its content, and `ui_open` gives each clip element its offset back through
   `Clay_GetScrollOffset()` before the declaration is configured — the two calls Clay's debug view makes, so the layout
   shifts the rows and the renderer's scissor cuts what leaves the box. `cssints/clay` needed **no new member**:
   `css.overflow("hidden")` was already the declaration and `pack.ts`/`ui_open` already carried the two clip flags for the
   floats. The page is 30 rows in a 240px viewport with the readout and the footer as its siblings, so they stay put; the
   wheel scrolls, and one Tab stop takes Up/Down, PageUp/PageDown and Home/End, which move the selection (clamped to
   0..29) and `ui_scroll_to` the view the least it takes to show the moved row, measured from the row's and the
   viewport's `ui.bounds` of the last frame. Check: four stored frames (the top, 32 notches down
   with both edges cut, the selection moved to row 13 with the view scrolled to it, the light theme) and
   `solid/list.test.ts` (10px a notch and the rows moving by exactly that, both clamps, the clip's pixels above the
   viewport, the keyboard reveal and its bounds, the wheel not moving the selection, the header and footer unmoved, the
   ring's pixels, the wheel only under the pointer, the page fitting). Dropping the scroll-into-view fails eleven of them.
   Seen by eye: the four frames; the window started (`--frames 60`, exit 0) but its wheel and keys were not tried by hand
   (the screen is not visible to me). Left: horizontal scrolling, momentum, dragging the list with the pointer, a
   scrollbar (the page has a "n of 30" readout instead) and dragging one, and scrolling the page itself when the wheel is
   outside the viewport (Clay scrolls the container under the pointer only).
   **Done: the accessibility tree** (`solid/a11y.ts`, `solid/a11y.test.ts`). `snapshot(root, { parts, containers })`
   walks the rendered tree in document order and returns `{ role, name, value, states: { checked, expanded, selected,
   disabled, focused, hidden }, hasPopup, level, bounds, children }`: the name from the part's `label` / `labelledBy`
   (resolved to the text of the element it names) / the text of its descendants outside nested roles, `hidden` pruned
   with its subtree, and an open modal dialog's page pruned as a screen reader sees it (not marked hidden); `bounds` is
   `ui.bounds` of the box's id. Check: the Widgets snapshot (13 page-level roles, the radiogroup/tablist/toolbar/tree
   groups with their items, the mixed and disabled boxes, the slider's `40%`, `hasPopup` on the menu button, the
   Tab-focused switch's path), the Field and Dialog pages (the dialog alone while open), a hand-built tree for
   `labelledBy`, `hidden`, nesting and absent bounds, and two mutations (no `labelledBy` resolution fails 3 asserts, no
   hidden pruning 1). Left: the pages spread only `input.bind(part)` (`id`, `focused`), so the roles and states in the
   test come from the parts it hands in, not from the tree — `<box {...part}>` (or `input.bind` carrying the fields) is
   the fix; the group boxes, the field's label, the disclosure/tree marks (`+`/`-` in the names), the dialog's
   `labelledby` and the backdrop are the gaps that fix will have to close.
5. **JSX to C.** The same component evaluated at build time to C calls, for targets with no JS. Check: its render
   commands equal step 4's for the same state.
6. **Terminal.** Clay in cells, `termbox2` renderer, the desktop's focus and input; csssky-tui ported. Check:
   csssky-tui's screen tests on the new renderer. Then deprecate `cssints/tui` (in cssints).
7. **Back to the board.** esp32's `ui.c` reads generated `styles.h` and C from step 5; then the browser (WASM) and the
   ESP32-P4. Checked by hand in the live window (2026-10-19): Tab order and ring, Space on release, the switch, Select all and mixed, Details, click focus, `t`.


## Not doing

- JS on a microcontroller. A GPU path on the ESP32-S3. One style for cells and pixels. A layout engine of our own.
