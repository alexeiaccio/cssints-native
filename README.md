# cssints-native

A native UI framework on [cssints](../css-in-ts-compiler) styles and [Clay](https://github.com/nicbarker/clay)
layout: the desktop on the GPU first, then an ESP32 with no JS on the chip. The plan and the targets are in
[docs/map.md](docs/map.md).

```ts
import * as css from "cssints/clay" with { type: "cssints" };

export const units = css.cn(css.width(200), css.height(38), css.bg("rgb(36 40 52)"), css.borderRadius(19));
```

```sh
node --conditions=development generator/clay-header.ts styles.ts styles.h   # C for CLAY(CLAY_ID("Units"), units)
```

## Layout

```
generator/clay-header.ts   styles.ts -> styles.h through the cssints plugin
examples/units/            the pill proven on the board, and same.c: generated vs hand-written, same render commands
examples/sensors/          the Sensors page: styles.ts, page.c, its stored frames
desktop/                   host.c (SDL3 window or a headless frame), clay_renderer_thorvg.c, build.sh
solid/                     Solid 2 on the desktop: a universal renderer over Clay through bun:ffi; the Sensors and Widgets pages (solid/README.md)
focus/                     the focus manager: Tab order, roving focus in groups, restore (no DOM), focus/README.md
vendor/                    clay.h and Clay's SDL3 renderer (e6cc369), a font
headless/                  button, switch, checkbox, disclosure as signals + neutral parts, checked against Quint specs
docs/map.md                targets, layers, order of work
```

## Test

```sh
bun install
bun run test     # generator, same.c against esp32's clay.h, the Sensors frames on SDL and on ThorVG (needs brew sdl3 sdl3_ttf sdl3_image thorvg)
sh desktop/build.sh examples/sensors && ./build/sensors/app   # the window, ThorVG's software raster; the t key toggles the theme
./build/sensors/app --raster sdl                              # Clay's SDL3 renderer instead (the window uses the GPU)
bun solid/main.ts widgets                                     # Solid: headless button, switch, checkboxes, disclosure, radio, tabs, slider, toolbar; Tab, arrows, Space work
./build/sensors/app --press 180 250 --png out.png             # headless: a press held at 180,250, the frame written while pressed
```

`cssints` is linked from the `clay-target` worktree of css-in-ts-compiler until `cssints/clay` is released.
